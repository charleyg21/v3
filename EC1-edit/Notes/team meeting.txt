main issue -- overflow not implemented
    safety feature: overflow valve implementation
    2-second delay or appropriate? so system doesnt shut down
        rotary valve should go to home-- safe mode
        turn off heaters, etc.

Prime function does a flush, by enabling sol_valve, then rinsing for 90 seconds for each number of rinses, then resets the sol_valve. The rinse function, is not time-based, and instead loops for each rinse, and does the following: move valve to water_in, full syringe, move valve to water_out, rehome synringe. Do we need to add flushing to the rinse method?

What to set version to?

remove purge from startup

bugs:
adjust dose, hardcode or hidden menu item ??
dosing too much of material-- hard coded number of steps in stepper motor is drawing too much liquid by about 15% -- lower 15%

                From syringe.cpp line 361:

                // Calibrated by pulling syringe until stepper slips and taking 75% of steps.
            //    constexpr int32_t max_step_count = 75'000;
                // John: Changed to 95000 of steps (by Sherman).
                // John: Changed to 75% of steps (by John).
                //constexpr int32_t max_step_count = 95'000;
                constexpr int32_t max_step_count = 65'000;

                // Measured about 75 mL of liquid with 25,000 syringe steps.
            //    constexpr uint32_t steps_per_ml = 333;
                // John: Changed to 324 steps / ml (by Sherman)
                constexpr uint32_t steps_per_ml = 324;
